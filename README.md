## What is GraphiQL.NET?

GraphiQL.NET saves you from needing any additional dependencies by allowing you to include the GraphiQL in-browser editor directly into your ASP.NET Core application via middleware, allowing you to explore and test your GraphQL endpoint with ease.

## Installation

The GraphiQL.NET middleware can be [found on NuGet here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/graphiql/)

You can install GraphiQL.NET by copying and pasting the following command into your Package Manager Console within Visual Studio (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console).

```
Install-Package graphiql
```

Alternatively you can install it using the .NET Core CLI using the following command:

```
dotnet add package graphiql
```

## Getting Started

Once installed you can add GraphiQL.NET to your ASP.NET Core application by adding the `app.UseGraphiQl()` middleware to the `Configure` method within your `Startup.cs` file.

**Note: Be sure to call `UseGraphiQl()` before `UseMvc()`.**

```csharp

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    app.UseGraphiQl();

    app.UseMvc();
}
```

After that simply navigate to `/graphql` in your browser to start using GraphiQL.

## Configuration

By default GraphiQL lives on the aforementioned `/graphql` endpoint, however it can be changed by passing your chosen path to the `app.UseGraphiQl();` entry point method:

```csharp
app.UseGraphiQl('/whatever/graphiql');
```
